    <h1>Node etc.</h1>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript
        Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable
        network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
        scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's
        web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application
        development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and
        client-side scripts.</p>

<h3>Running .js files using Node</h3>
<p>On the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>
    node firstScript.js
    <span class="red">the JS file will run inside the terminal</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>The process object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. As a
    global, it is always available to Node.js applications without using require().</p>
<p>We can compare process to the window object on a browser.</p>
<h3>process.argv</h3>
<p>The process.argv property returns an array containing the command line arguments passed when the Node.js process was
    launched. The first element will be process.execPath. The process.execPath property returns the absolute pathname of
    the executable that started the Node.js process: usually '/usr/local/bin/node'. The second element will be the path
    to the JavaScript file being executed. The remaining elements will be any additional command line arguments.</p>
<pre><code>
    node firstScript.js puppies chickens hello
    <span class="red">these 3 strings will be added to the argv array.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>process.argv returns an array, and can be accessed from the js file.</p>

<h3>File System Module (fs)</h3>
<p>The fs module enables interacting with the file system. </p>
<p>All file system operations have synchronous, callback, and promise-based forms.</p>
<p>Unlike the process object, the fs module must be required before being used in the script.</p>
<p>Example: creating a script that creates boilerplates files (index.html, style.css, app.js) for a new project.</p>
<pre><code>
on script:
const fs = require('fs'); <span class="red">requires fs module</span>
const folderName = process.argv[2] || 'Project'; <span class="red">accesses the argument that was provided by the user</span>
fs.mkdirSync(folderName); <span class="red">creates a folder with the name provided by the user</span>
fs.writeFileSync(`${folderName}/index.html`)
fs.writeFileSync(`${folderName}/style.css`)
fs.writeFileSync(`${folderName}/app.js`)
<span class="red">creates these 3 files inside that folder</span>

on the command line:
node boilerplate.js Portfolio
<span class="red">creates a folder called Portfolio with those 3 files inside of it.</span>
</code></pre>
